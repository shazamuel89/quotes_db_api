- When author or category is deleted, go through quotes and find quotes that had that author_id/category_id and update them to 'Author Deleted'/'Category Deleted'
- Go through and find small repeated operations that can be extracted and modified into functions

OPTIONAL
- Allow a “random=true” parameter to be sent via GET request so the response received does not always
contain the same quote. The response should contain a random quote that still adheres to the other specified
parameters. For example, this will allow users of the API to retrieve a single random quote, a single random
quote from Bill Gates (author), or a single random quote about life (category).
